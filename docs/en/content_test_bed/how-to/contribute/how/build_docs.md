# Building documentation

To begin working on documentation, you first need to be [working on a branch](branches.md), and have a [development environment](dev_environment.md) set up.

{% extends "contribute/how/build_docs.md" %}

{% block end_matter %}

Once you have successfully built the docs, you are ready to [write documentation](write_docs.md).

{% endblock %}
