# Writing, running, and testing code

To begin working on code, you first need to be [working on a branch](git_feature_branch.md), and have a [development environment](dev_environment.md) set up.

{% extends "how/code_run_test.md" %}

{% block end_matter %}

Once you have everything working, you are likely ready to [submit a pull request](pr_submit.md).

{% endblock %}
