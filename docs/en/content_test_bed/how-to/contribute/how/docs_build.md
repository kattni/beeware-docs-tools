# Building documentation

To begin working on documentation, you first need to be [working on a branch](git_feature_branch.md), and have a [development environment](dev_environment.md) set up.

{% extends "how/docs_build.md" %}

{% block end_matter %}

Once you have the docs building, you are ready to [write documentation](docs_contribute.md).

{% endblock %}
