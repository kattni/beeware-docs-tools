# Reproducing an issue

To begin reproducing an issue, you will need a [development environment](dev_environment.md) set up.

{% extends "how/issue_reproduce.md" %}

{% block end_matter %}

What you do next depends on whether you intend to pick another issue to reproduce, in which case, you can go through the steps above again, or if you plan to [fix the issue](../what/issue_fix_process.md).

{% endblock %}
