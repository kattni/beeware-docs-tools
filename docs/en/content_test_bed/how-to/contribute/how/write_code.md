# Writing, running, and testing code

To begin working on code, you first need to be [working on a branch](branches.md), and have a [development environment](dev_environment.md) set up.

{% extends "contribute/how/write_code.md" %}

{% block end_matter %}

Once you have everything working, you can [submit a pull request](submit_pr.md) with your changes.

{% endblock %}
