# Writing documentation

Before you begin writing documentation, ensure you are able to [build the documentation](build_docs.md)

{% extends "contribute/how/write_docs.md" %}

{% block end_matter %}

Once you are happy with your new documentation, you can [submit a pull request](submit_pr.md) with your proposed changes.

{% endblock %}
