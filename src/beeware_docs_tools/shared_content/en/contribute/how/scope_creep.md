"Scope creep" happens when the list of problems resolved or features implemented by a single contribution grows significantly beyond what was intended when the work began. You start with a simple issue; you discover a closely related problem, and decide to include that fix as well; then a third... before you know it, you've got a pull request that closes 5 issues and adds 3 new features, including dozens of files.

Scope creep happens to everyone. It is a concept that is all too familiar to seasoned developers; we've all done it multiple times, and experienced all the issues that come with it.

There are very practical reasons to avoid scope creep. The larger a contribution gets, the more difficult it is to work with. It becomes harder to identify edge cases or potential problems, which means overall quality of the contribution may be diminished. Reviews also become more challenging when the reviewer needs to deal with multiple, potentially unrelated, contexts. A larger contribution means more review comments, and as a contributor, it can become difficult to follow multiple review threads. Even your GitHub experience will suffer - GitHub's UI will slow down as the size of a PR grows, meaning navigating the files through the GitHub interface and attempting to leave review comments becomes increasingly difficult.

Any time you find a reason to add anything to your contribution that isn't explicitly part of the original proposal or bug report, you should consider whether you're heading into scope creep. Are there two distinct features that could be implemented separately? Could a feature be implemented with a known limitation or bug, and that bug fixed in a follow-up pull request? Is one part of a bug fix independent of another? If part of a change can be left out without altering the original contribution, it probably should be.

Developing software is always a process of incremental improvement. Each individual contribution should leave the code base in a better state as a result of being merged, but it's entirely acceptable to leave bugs or parts of features as work for future improvement. That might mean breaking a pull request into multiple parts that can be reviewed independently, or logging an issue so that someone else can investigate and resolve the problem.

Limiting the scope of each contribution helps everyone involved, including you. Your reviewers, and even you, will appreciate it.
