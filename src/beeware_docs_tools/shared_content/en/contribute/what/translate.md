While English is a very common language for software developers, there are many developers who don't speak English, or don't speak it fluently. This is an accessibility issue for developers - and so, we want to provide our documentation in as many languages as possible.

Unfortunately, the BeeWare core team is, for the most part, monolingual English speakers. We need your help to translate our documentation into other languages.

We use Weblate to manage our translations. Weblate is a tool that lets us treat every paragraph of content in our documentation as a to-do list that we can work through, one at a time.

We use [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator) for machine translation to produce a first pass at translations. Machine translations are far from perfect, but they're usually good enough as a first draft. The expectation is that these machine translations will be edited, reviewed, and improved as necessary.
