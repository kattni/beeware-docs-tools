## Can I contribute?

Yes! We have opportunities for folks at every experience level to contribute. Whether this is your first time contributing to open source, or you've been doing it for years, we have something that will work for you.

## What can I do?

### [Triage an issue](issue_triage_process.md)

If an issue has no comments from anyone other than the original reporter, it needs to be triaged. [Triaging an issue](issue_triage_process.md) involves taking the information provided by the reporter, and trying to reproduce it.

### [Fix an issue](issue_fix_process.md)

Once the source of an issue is identified, the next step is to resolve it. [Fixing an issue](issue_fix_process.md) involves TODO: finish.

### [Review a pull request](pr_review_process.md)

Once a pull request is submitted, it needs to be reviewed before it can be merged. Regardless of whether you are deeply familiar with the content, there is likely a way you can help with [reviewing a pull request](pr_review_process.md).

### [Propose a new feature](feature_proposal_process.md)
