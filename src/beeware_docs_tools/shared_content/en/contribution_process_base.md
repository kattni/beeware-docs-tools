## The review process

### Providing a review

TODO: Intro. You should engage in the following when reviewing submissions from others, and you should expect the following from anyone reviewing your submissions.

TODO: segue.

* Positive.
* Supportive.
* Constructive.
* Helpful.



### Receiving a review



#### Timeline and feedback

We aim to begin a review within ten business days, however, with more complicated submissions, that timeline may be extended.

We typically maintain continuity with reviewers on each pull request, which is to say, you'll likely work with the same reviewer for your entire review. This provides a smoother experience for everyone involved. Your reviewer will have context throughout the process, and you'll be able to learn what to expect in terms of response cadence and review style.

TODO: something about responding to feedback.

### Change requests

Most of the time, your reviewer is going to request changes on your pull request. This isn't a reflection of your work, it's simply part of the process.

#### Work through requested changes



#### Submit all requested changes



#### Request a rereview



Repeat the three above steps until no further changes are needed.

### PR approval and merge
