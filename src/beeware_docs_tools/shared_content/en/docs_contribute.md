These are the steps to follow to write your documentation contribution to {{ formal_name }}.

Ensure you are able to [build the documentation](docs_build.md) before beginning to write.

### Existing documentation

If you're editing the existing docs, you'll need to locate the file in the `/docs/en` directory. The file structure follows the page structure, so you can locate the file using the documentation URL.

TODO: New document, adding to SUMMARY.md

Open the file in your editor, and find and update the text as required.

TODO: link to style guide etc.
