These are the steps to follow to write your documentation contribution to {{ formal_name }}.

Ensure you are able to [build the documentation](docs_build.md) before beginning to write.

### Existing documentation

If you're editing the existing docs, you'll need to locate the file in the `/docs/en` directory. The file structure follows the page structure, so you can locate the file using the documentation URL.

Open the file in your editor, and find and update the intended text.

For small fixes, such as typos or grammar, you can make the fix and [submit a pull request](pr_submit.md), without necessarily needing prior discussion.

For more substantial changes, you'll want to follow the [proposal process][suggesting-new-docs] to let us know what you have in mind, and allows us to discuss it.

### Writing new documentation

If you're writing entirely new content, you'll want to follow the [proposal process][suggesting-new-docs] to provide us with an opportunity to work with you on what you're interested in contributing, how it fits into the existing documentation, and what form of documentation makes the most sense.

Once approved, you'll write up your new documentation.
