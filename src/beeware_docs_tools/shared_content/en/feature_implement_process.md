### Convert to a formal feature request

Once the discussion has reached a consensus on the form of a feature, you can create a new [feature request issue](https://github.com/beeware/{{ project_name }}/issues/new/choose), in the {{ formal_name }} issue tracker, that summarizes the discussion, linking to the discussion for context.

### Implement your idea

You can now start implementing your idea. If your suggestion involves code, you can use [this guide](feature_implement_process.md) to walk you through the process of contributing code to {{ formal_name }}. If your suggestion involves documentation, you can use [this guide](docs_process.md) instead.
