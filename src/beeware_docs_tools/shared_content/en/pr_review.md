## PR submitted; now what?

After submitting your pull request, you'll need to wait for the review process to begin.

## The review process

### Providing a review

-8<- "pr_review_process.md"

### Receiving a review

#### Timeline and feedback

We aim to begin a review within ten business days, however, with more complicated submissions, that timeline may be extended.

We typically maintain continuity with reviewers on each pull request, which is to say, you'll likely work with the same reviewer for your entire review. This provides a smoother experience for everyone involved. Your reviewer will have context throughout the process, and you'll be able to learn what to expect in terms of response cadence and review style.

TODO: something about responding to initial feedback and questions. Have we understood what this is doing correctly, can you explain this edge case. There may be questions that come as part of the review process that are not the conclusion of the review. That's the change requests.

### Change requests

Most of the time, your reviewer is going to request changes on your pull request. This isn't a reflection of your work, it's simply part of the process.

#### Work through requested changes

Your reviewer will post comments to your PR. These comments can be general, on a specific file, or on a specific line or lines of code. They will sometimes include directly suggested changes that you can apply to your PR through the GitHub UI. Typically, they will be questions, requests for clarification, or guidance on updates.

#### Submit all requested changes

If an issue is particularly complicated, and fixing one will impact another thing, you can ask for a review on the specific piece you've updated. Be sure to specify exactly what you're looking for.

#### Re-request a review

Once you have resolved all the requested changes in a given review, you can re-request a review from your reviewer.

Repeat the three above steps until no further changes are needed.

## PR approval and merge

will almost always be merged immediately, unless extenuating circumstances like codependency with another PR
