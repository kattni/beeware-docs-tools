TODO: segue.

Before engaging in a review, THINK. As reviewers, we should consider whether the response we're about to send is:

* True. Always strive to provide accurate suggestions and information.
* Helpful. We are providing guidance on how to improve the submission; this guidance should clearly identify the source of a problem or an unconsidered use case, and ideally provides a path forward for what would resolve or satisfy the concern.
* Inspiring. It is up to us to inspire the author to want to work through our requested changes.
* Necessary. The expectation is that the author will read everything we post; we must respect their time and effort by only posting necessary replies.
* Kind. There are multiple ways to present the same feedback; we need to ensure we are choosing to be kind, supportive, and constructive with our words.
