TODO: segue.

Before engaging in a review, THINK. As reviewers, we should consider whether the response we're about to send is:

* True. Always strive to provide accurate suggestions and information.
* Helpful. We are providing guidance on how to improve the submission; this guidance should clearly identify the source of a problem or an unconsidered use case, and ideally provides a path forward for what would resolve or satisfy the concern.
* Inspiring. It is up to us to inspire the author to want to work through our requested changes.
* Necessary. The expectation is that the author will read everything we post; we must respect their time and effort by only posting necessary replies.
* Kind. There are multiple ways to present the same feedback; we need to ensure we are choosing to be kind, supportive, and constructive with our words.

TODO: segue.

It is entirely possible to THINK, while providing a thorough review. Contributors won't have the opportunity to improve if they are unaware of areas needing improvement.

It's important to remember to provide positive feedback in addition to identifying the areas needing improvement. If, for example, the changes are especially helpful, do something particularly clever, or you are introduced to an API that you didn't know about, let the author know! Never underestimate the effect of pointing out something someone has done correctly or well, in the middle of a situation where everything else you've pointed out are issues that need to be resolved.
